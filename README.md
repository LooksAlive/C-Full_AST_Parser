# C-Full_AST_Parser
C-Full_AST_Parser should be full C parser that makes AST nodes in memory, this allows for generating nodes in memory (abitily to construct, add, remove nodes from AST tree). Also exposes ability to dump Node structure in JSON and dump AST as code. Idea was taken from python's AST. IS might not be fastest implementation(i try to), but still good.)
